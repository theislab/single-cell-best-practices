Warning: This project and repository is under heavy development. We will tell you when it is ready.

A version of the book is rendered [here](https://sc-best-practices.org).
We are not making regular releases yet and the rendered version is likely to be out of date.

## Mission

We are writing a book on the current single-cell analysis best-practices with extensive tutorials and code examples.

## Contributing

We would like to invite the community to further improve the tutorial and the teaching material.
Please read [contributing](https://github.com/theislab/single-cell-best-practices/blob/development/CONTRIBUTING.md) for further instructions.

In case of questions or problems, please get in touch by posting an issue in this repository.

## Adapting the notebooks to other datasets:

All notebooks for the various steps can be found in the [jupyter book folder](single-cell-best-practices/tree/master/jupyter-book).
These can easily be reused for your own projects.

## Acknowledgements

This tutorial would not be possible without the input of all Theislab members and the countless benchmarks and reviews of various single-cell tools by the community.
