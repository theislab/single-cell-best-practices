This repository is complementary to the publication:

M.D. Luecken, F.J. Theis, "Current best practices in single-cell RNA-seq analysis: a tutorial", Molecular Systems Biology 15(6) (2019): e8746

The paper was recommended on F1000 prime as being of special significance in the field.

If the materials in this repository are of use to you, please consider citing our above publications.

## Adapting the notebooks to other datasets:

All notebooks for the various steps can be found in the [jupyter book folder](extended-single-cell-best-practices/tree/master/jupyter-book). 
These can easily be reused for your own projects.

## Acknowledgements

This tutorial would not be possible without the input of all Theislab members and the countless benchmarks and reviews of various single-cell tools by the community.
