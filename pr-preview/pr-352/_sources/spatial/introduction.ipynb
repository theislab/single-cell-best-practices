        "Bulk and single-cell genomic technologies enabled us to characterize and understand cellular identities and their dependencies on genome scale. Up to this point, all single-cell technologies described in this work characterized dissociated cells that were removed from the sample of interest. However, by removing the spatial context of the cells and their molecules, one also loses the spatial context which is an essential component for many biological questions. Spatially resolved genomics resolve this issue by measuring both genome-scale omics and preserving the spatial information. "

        "Spatially resolved genomics can be measured with various technologies that quantify the transcriptome, proteome or chromatin accessibility. However, these technologies vary in terms of scale, resolution, sensitivity, multiplexing and applicability. As the landscape of spatially resolved genomics is developing fast and is expected to change massively in the next few years, we are introducing only three overall groups of spatial omics technologies based on their capturing resolution. Additional information can be obtained through the linked reviews and papers following this introduction. {cite}`moffitt_emerging_2022` {cite}`walker_deciphering_2022` {cite}`yue_guidebook_2023`\n",

Multi-cell resolution data can be decomposed with deconvolution methods to obtain proportions of different cells or cell types per spot.\n",

By performing cell segmentation on sub-cellular data one can obtain single-cell resolution data where expression is aggregated to cell-wise measurements which than can be processed in spatially-aware analysis pipelines. We will show how to perform this analysis for a MERFISH dataset.\n",
