This book uses [lamindb](https://github.com/laminlabs/lamindb) to store, share, and load datasets and notebooks using the [theislab/sc-best-practices instance](https://lamin.ai/theislab/sc-best-practices).
We acknowledge free hosting from [Lamin Labs](https://lamin.ai/).

1. **Install lamindb**

   - Install the lamindb Python package:

   ```bash
   pip install lamindb[bionty,jupyter,zarr]
   ```

2. **Optionally create a lamin account**

   - Sign up and log in following [the instructions](https://docs.lamin.ai/setup#sign-up-log-in)

3. **Connect to the [theislab/sc-best-practices instance](https://lamin.ai/theislab/sc-best-practices)**

   - Run the `lamin connect` command:

   ```bash
   lamin connect theislab/sc-best-practices
   ```

You should now see `â†’ connected lamindb: theislab/sc-best-practices`.

4. **Verify your setup**

   - Run the `lamin connect` command:

   ```python
   import lamindb as ln

   ln.Artifact.df()
   ```

   You should now see up to 100 of the stored datasets.

5. **Accessing datasets (Artifacts)**

   - Search for the datasets on the [Artifacts page](https://lamin.ai/theislab/sc-best-practices/artifacts)
   - Load an Artifact and the corresponding object:

   ```python
   import lamindb as ln
   af = ln.Artifact.get(key="key_of_dataset", is_latest=True)  # or ln.Artifact("SOMEID").get()
   obj = af.load()
   ```

   The object is now accessible in memory and is ready for analysis.
   Adapt the `ln.Artifact("SOMEID").get()` suffix to get older versions like `ln.Artifact("SOMEID0001").get()` to get the second uploaded version.

6. **Accessing notebooks (Transforms)**

   - Search for the notebook on the [Transforms page](https://lamin.ai/theislab/sc-best-practices/transforms)
   - Load the notebook:

   ```bash
   lamin load <notebook url>
   ```

   which will download the notebook to the current working directory.
   Analogously to `Artifacts`, you can adapt the suffix ID to get older versions.

7. **On `ln.track()` and `ln.finish()`**

   - These functions are currently only available for users with write access and may error. Please comment them out for now.
