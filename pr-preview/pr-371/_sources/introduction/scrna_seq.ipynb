        "Although DNA was already first isolated in 1869 by Friedrich Miescher, it took the scientific community more than 100 years to develop high-throughput sequencing technologies.\n",
        "In 1953, Watson, Crick, and Franklin discovered the structure of DNA, and in 1965, Robert Holley sequenced the first tRNA.\n",
        "Seven years later, in 1972, Walter Fiers was the first to sequence a complete gene (the coat protein of bacteriophage MS2) using RNases to digest the virus RNA, isolate oligonucleotides and finally separate them with electrophoresis and chromatography {cite}`Jou1972`.\n",
        "In parallel, Frederick Sanger developed a DNA sequencing method using radiolabeled, partially digested fragments termed \"chain termination method\", which is more commonly known as \"Sanger Sequencing\".\n",
        "Although Sanger Sequencing is still used today, it has suffered from several shortcomings, including lack of automation and being time-consuming.\n",
        "In 1987, Leroy Hood and Michael Hunkapiller developed the ABI 370, an instrument that automates the Sanger Sequencing process.\n",
        "Its most crucial innovative accomplishment was the automatic labeling of DNA fragments with fluorescent dyes instead of radioactive molecules.\n",
        "This change not only made the method safer to perform but also allowed computers to analyze the acquired data {cite}`Hood1987`.\n",

        "\n",
        "Nine years later, in 1996, Mostafa Ronaghi, Mathias Uhlen, and P\u0227l Ny\u0155en revolutionized DNA sequencing by developing pyrosequencing, marking the beginning of second-generation sequencing.\n",
        "Second-generation sequencing, also known as next-generation sequencing (NGS), was primarily made possible by further automation in the lab, the usage of computers, and the miniaturization of reactions.\n",
        "Pyrosequencing measures luminescence that is generated by pyrophosphate synthesis during sequencing.\n",
        "This process is also commonly known as \"sequencing-by-synthesis\".\n",
        "Two years later, Shankar Balasubramanian and David Klenerman developed and adapted the sequencing-by-synthesis process for a new method that utilizes fluorescent dyes at the company Solexa.\n",
        "Solexa\u2019s technology also forms the basis of Illumina\u2019s sequencers, which dominate today's market.\n",
        "The Roche 454 sequencer, developed in 2005, was the first sequencer to fully automate the pyrosequencing process in a single, automated machine.\n",
        "Life Technologies introduced several other platforms, including SOLiD in 2007 (a \"sequencing-by-ligation\" system) and Ion Torrent in 2011 (detecting hydrogen ions during the synthesis of new DNA).\n",
        "In general, sequencing-by-synthesis involves adding single nucleotides to a growing DNA strand and detecting each addition.\n",
        "At the same time, sequencing-by-ligation relies on detecting the joining of short DNA probes to the fragment to determine the sequence.\n",

        "First, long-read sequencing, which enables the detection of nucleotide fragments that are much longer than those generated by second-generation sequencing.\n",
        "The typical Illumina short-read sequencers generate fragments ranging from 75 to 300 base pairs, depending on the model.\n",
        "With third-generation sequencing, sequencers can read tens of thousands of base pairs.\n",

        "This is also the reason why we model mRNA transcription with a negative binomial distribution.\n",
        "This distribution is ideal because it models event counts (mRNA) while capturing overdispersion (variance exceeding the mean) caused by transcriptional bursts {cite}`ren2020negative,love2015deseq2`.\n",
        "\n",
        "The initial RNA transcript, known as pre-mRNA, then undergoes alternative splicing, a process that allows different regions (called introns and exons) of the transcript to be joined in multiple ways.\n",
        "This means that a single gene can give rise to multiple distinct mRNA isoforms.\n",
        "On average, each human gene produces about 3.4 mRNA isoforms {cite}`lee2015mechanisms`.\n",
        "While all human genes have at least two alternative isoforms, some push the limits of complexity.\n",
        "The human basonuclin 2 gene, for instance, has the potential to generate up to 90,000 mRNA isoforms, resulting in over 2,000 different proteins {cite}`vanhoutteghem2007human`.\n",
        "In some cases, however, alternative splicing could also lead to a non-functioning enzyme and an induced disease state.\n",
        "Finally, this \"mature\" mRNA is translated into proteins.\n",
        "Here, too, the numbers vary dramatically.\n",
        "In mammels, the median protein-to-mRNA ratio is estimated to be around 10,000 proteins per mRNA {cite}`li2014system`.\n",

        "An even coverage of transcripts is not always achieved with full-length protocols, and therefore specific regions across the gene body may still be biased.\n",

        "Tag-based protocols only sequence either the transcripts' 3' or 5' end.\n",
        "This comes at the cost of not (necessarily) covering the full gene length, making it difficult to unambiguously align reads to a transcript and distinguishing between different isoforms {cite}`Archer2016`.\n",
        "However, it allows for the usage of unique molecular identifiers ({term}`UMIs <Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI)>`), which are useful to resolve biases in the transcript amplification process.\n",

        "Upon lysis, the cell's mRNA is instantaneously released and captured by the barcoded oligonucleotides that are attached to the beads.\n",
        "Next, the droplets are collected and broken to release single-cell transcriptomes attached to microparticles (STAMPs).\n",
