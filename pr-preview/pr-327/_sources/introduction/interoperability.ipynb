    "As we have discussed in the {ref}`analysis frameworks and tools chapter <introduction:analysis-frameworks>` there are three main ecosystems for single-cell analysis, the [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/) and [Seurat](https://satijalab.org/seurat/index.html) ecosystems in R and the Python-based [scverse](https://scverse.org/) ecosystem. A common question from new analysts is which ecosystem they should focus on learning and using? While it makes sense to focus on one to start with, and a successful standard analysis can be performed in any ecosystem, we promote the idea that competent analysts should be familiar with all three ecosystems and comfortable moving between them. This approach allows analysts to use the best-performing tools and methods regardless of how they were implemented. When analysts are not comfortable moving between ecosystems they often tend to use packages that are easy to access, even when they have been shown to have shortcomings compared to packages in another ecosystem. The ability of analysts to move between ecosystems allows developers to take advantage of the different strengths of programming languages. For example, R has strong inbuilt support for complex statistical modelling while the majority of deep learning libraries are focused on Python. By supporting common on-disk data formats and in-memory data structures developers can be confident that analysts can access their package and can use the platform that is most appropriate for their method. Another motivation for being comfortable with multiple ecosystems is the accessibility and availability of data, results and documentation. Often data or results are only made available in one format and analysts will need to be familiar with that format in order to access it. A basic understanding of other ecosystems is also necessary to understand package documentation and tutorials when deciding which methods to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we encourage analysts to be comfortable with all the major ecosystems, moving between them is only possible when they are interoperable. Thankfully, lots of work has been done in this area and it is now relatively simple in most cases using standard packages. In this chapter, we discuss the various ways data can be moved between ecosystems via disk or in-memory, the differences between them and their advantages. We focus on single-modality data and moving between R and Python as these are the most common cases but we also touch on multimodal data and other languages."

    "The first approach to moving between languages is via disk-based interoperability. This involves writing a file to disk in one language and then reading that file into a second language. In many cases, this approach is simpler, more reliable and scalable than in-memory interoperability (which we discuss below) but it comes at the cost of greater storage requirements and reduced interactivity. Disk-based interoperability tends to work particularly well when there are established processes for each stage of analysis and you want to pass objects from one to the next (especially as part of a pipeline developed using a workflow manager such as [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/index.html) or [snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)). However, disk-based interoperability is less convenient for interactive steps such as data exploration or experimenting with methods as you need to write a new file whenever you want to move between languages."

    "Before discussing file formats specifically developed for single-cell data we want to briefly mention that common simple text file formats (such as CSV, TSV, JSON etc.) can often be the answer to transferring data between languages. They work well in cases where some analysis has been performed and what you want to transfer is a subset of the information about an experiment. For example, you may want to transfer only the cell metadata but do not require the feature metadata, expression matrices etc. The advantage of using simple text formats is that they are well supported by almost any language and do not require single-cell specific packages. However, they can quickly become impractical as what you want to transfer becomes more complex."

This is an open-source file format designed for storing large, complex and heterogeneous data. It has a file directory type structure (similar to how files and folders are organised on your computer) which allows many different kinds of data to be stored in a single file with an arbitrarily complex hierarchy. While this format is very flexible, to properly interact with it you need to know where and how the different information is stored.

    "The second approach to interoperability is to work on in-memory representations of an object. This approach involves active sessions from two programming languages running at the same time and either accessing the same object from both or converting between them as needed. Usually, one language acts as the main environment and there is an interface to the other language. This can be very useful for interactive analysis as it allows an analyst to work in two languages simultaneously. It is also often used when creating documents that use multiple languages (such as this book). However, in-memory interoperability has some drawbacks as it requires the analyst to be familiar with setting up and using both environments, more complex objects are often not supported by both languages and there is a greater memory overhead as data can easily become duplicated (making it difficult to use for larger datasets)."

    "The complexity of multimodal data presents additional challenges for interoperability.

    "To address this limitation, the `MuData` object (introduced in the [analysis frameworks and tools chapter]({ref}`analysis frameworks and tools chapter <introduction:analysis-frameworks>`) was developed as as an extension of `AnnData` for multimodal datasets. The developers have considered interoperability in their design. While the main platform for MuData is Python, the authors have provided the [MuDataSeurat R package](https://pmbio.github.io/MuDataSeurat/) for reading the on-disk H5MU format as `Seurat` objects and the [MuData R package](https://bioconductor.org/packages/MuData/) for doing the same with Bioconductor `MultiAssayExperiment` objects. This official support is very useful but there are still some inconsistencies due to differences between the objects. The MuData authors also provide a [Julia implementation](https://docs.juliahub.com/Muon/QfqCh/0.1.1/objects/) of `AnnData` and `MuData`.\n",
