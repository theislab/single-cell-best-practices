To infer RNA velocity, the time scale of the developmental process under investigation must be comparable to the half-life of RNA molecules.
This requirement is, for example, met in pancreatic endocrinogenesis {cite}`velo:BastidasPonce2019` but not in long term diseases such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease.
Similarly, RNA velocity analysis is not applicable to steady-state systems such as peripheral blood mononuclear cells lacking any transitions between (mature) cell types.

RNA velocity can only be inferred robustly and reliantly if the underlying model assumptions (approximately) hold true. 
To check the assumptions, the phase portraits can be studied to verify that they exhibit the expected almond shape.
If a gene includes multiple, pronounced kinetics, RNA velocity analysis should be applied with caution and the data possibly subsetted to individual lineages.

Classically, the high-dimensional RNA velocity vectors have been visualized by projecting them onto a low-dimensional representation of the data.
This approach for verifying hypotheses can be erronous and misleading as the projected velocity stream is highly dependent on (1) the number of included genes and (2) chosen plotting parameters.
Additionally, the projection quality decreases at the boundary of the low dimensional embedding {cite}`velo:LaManno2018`.
