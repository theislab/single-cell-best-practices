    "Single-cell sequencing assays provide high resolution measurements of biological tissues __<span style=\"color: red;\">[CITE]</span>__. Consequently, such technologies can help decipher and understand cellular heterogeneity __<span style=\"color: red;\">[CITE]</span>__ and the dynamics of a biological process __<span style=\"color: red;\">[CITE]</span>__. Corresponding studies include quantifying cellular fates as well as identifying genes driving the process. However, as cells are destroyed when sequenced, it is impossible to track their development and, for example,  gene expression profile over time. Instead, the underlying dynamic process needs to be estimated from the measured snapshot data."

    "Even though samples are, traditionally, taken from a single experimental time point, a multitude of cell types can be observed. This diversity stems from the asynchronous nature of biological processes. As such, a range of the developmental process can be observed. Reconstructing the developmental landscape is the goal of the field coined trajectory inference (TI). This task is achieved by ordering the observed cellular states according to the developmental process. States are aligned along the developmental direction by mapping discrete annotations to a continuous domain - the so-called _pseudotime_."

    "A pseudotime ranks cells relative to each other according to their respective stage in the developmental process. Less mature cells are assigned small, mature cells large values. Studying a bone marrow sample for example, hematopoietic stem cells are assigned a low, and erythroid cells a high pseudotime. The assignment is, in case of single-cell RNA sequencing data, based on the transcriptomic profile of a cell. Additionally, the construction usually requires the specification of an initial, or, equivalently, root cell where the overall process starts."

    "Pseudotime construction generally follows a common workflow: As a first step, the ultra high-dimensional single-cell data is projected onto a lower dimensional representation. This procedure is justified by the observation that dynamical processes progress on a low-dimensional manifold. In practice, pseudotime methods may rely on principal components (for example Palantir __<span style=\"color: red;\">[CITE]</span>__) or diffusion components (for example diffusion pseudotime (DPT) __<span style=\"color: red;\">[CITE]</span>__). Following, pseudotimes are constructed based on one of the following principles."

    "1. Observations are first clustered and, following, connections between these clusters identified. The clusters can be ordered and, thereby, a pseudotime constructed. Henceforth, we will refer to this apporoach as the _cluster approach_. Classical cluster algorithms include $k$-means __<span style=\"color: red;\">[CITE]</span>__, Louvain __<span style=\"color: red;\">[CITE]</span>__, or hierarchical clustering __<span style=\"color: red;\">[CITE]</span>__. Clusters may be connected based on similarity, or by constructing a minimum spanning tree (MST) __<span style=\"color: red;\">[CITE]</span>__.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The _graph approach_ first finds connections between the lower dimensional representation of the observations. This procedure defines a graph based on which clusters, and thus an ordering, are defined. *PAGA* __<span style=\"color: red;\">[CITE]</span>__, for example, partitions the graph into Louvain clusters and estimates connections between them. Intuitively, this approach preserves the global topology of the data while analyzing it at a lower resolution. Consequently, the computational efficiency is increased.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *Manifold-learning based approaches* proceed similar to the *cluster approach*. However, connections between clusters are defined by using principal curves or graphs to estimate the underlying trajectories. Principal curves find a one-dimensional curve that connects cellular observations in the higher dimensional space. A notable representation of this approach is Slingshot __<span style=\"color: red;\">[CITE]</span>__.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Probabilistic frameworks assign transition probabilities to ordered cell-cell pairs. Each transition probabilitiy quantifies how likely the reference cell is the ancestor of the other cell. These probabilities define random processes that are used to define a pseudotime. DPT, for example, is defined as the difference between consecutive states of a random walk. Contrastingly, Palantir __<span style=\"color: red;\">[CITE]</span>__ models trajectories themselves as Markov chains. While both approaches rely on a probabilistic framework, they require a root cell to be specified. The pseudotime itself is computed with respect to this cell."

    "TI is a well-studied field providing a rich set of methods. To apply the appropriate method to analyze a single-cell dataset, the biological process itself needs to be understood first.

Similarly, orthogonal processes within one and the same dataset limits the TI methods applicable.

    "Even though TI and pseudotime can already provide valuable insight, they usually act as a stepping stone for more fine grained analysis. Identifying terminal states, for example, is a classical biological question that can be studied. Similarly, lineage bifurcation and genes driving fate decisions can be identified based on TI and pseudotime. Which question can answere and how the answer is found is usually method specific. Palantir, for example, identifies terminal states as absorbing states of its constructed Markov chain."

    "The success of trajectory inference is well documented and, consequently, many methods have been proposed.
