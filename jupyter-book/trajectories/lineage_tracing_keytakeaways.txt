Remember, the **resolution of experimental data** is still limited.
**Statistical analysis** and **assessment of the quality** of lineage information shall be performed in order to identify individuals for which lineage reconstruction can be applied.
As demonstrated below there are dedicated tools which easily provide the relevant statistics.

Often it is difficult to presume **which algorithm** will perform best for reconstruction, and even algorithms with good performances might highlight different part of lineages. 
It is recommended that you **apply a few algorithms** for reconstruction for comparisons.

As with any analysis without a certain ground truth, any **conclusions must be carefully drawn**.
First and foremost, it is always good practice to visualize lineages along with the indel heatmap to verify that no obvious reconstruction errors were made (see the section entitled "Reconstructing the lineage" for more tips on how to evaluate reconstruction accuracy by eye).
Additionally, an effective strategy for drawing stronger conclusions is to compare downstream analyses on the same lineage inferred with different algorithms.
Of course, as with most matters concerning computational conclusions, we often suggest that conclusions are validated in an experimental system.
