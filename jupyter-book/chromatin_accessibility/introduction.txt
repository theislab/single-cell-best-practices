Chromatin accessibility is a key determinant of cell identity, providing an orthogonal layer of information to gene expression profiles. It reflects the combined regulatory state of a cell, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and transcription factor activity, which collectively influence gene expression and cell differentiation processes.

ScATAC-seq data is highly sparse due to the limited number of DNA copies per cell, leading to many features with zero counts. Defining biologically meaningful features, such as peaks or genome bins, is crucial for analysis, but it can be challenging to capture cell-type-specific accessibility.
