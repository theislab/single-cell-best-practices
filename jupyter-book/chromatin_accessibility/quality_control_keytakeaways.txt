1
Use two orthogonal methods for robust doublet scoring leveraging the count distribution of simulated doublets as well as the number of genomic positions with more than two counts.
Keep in mind that the latter requires a sufficient sequencing depth (> 10-15k reads per cell).

2
Use the total number of fragments, the number of features and scATAC- specific metrics like the transcription start site (TSS) enrichment score and the nucleosome signal to identify low quality cells.
Remove barcodes with extreme values in any of the QC metrics (mostly upper bound thresholds).
Remove the majority of low-quality cells mostly represented by a low total number of fragments combined with a low TSS enrichment score per cell.

3
Filter features considering the total number of cells in the data set and the objective of the analysis.
If no rare cell states are of interest, features can be filtered to be present in at least 1% of the cells. If rare cell populations are of interest consider using a minimal number of cells that features should be detected in.
