Sequencing evolved from **Sanger sequencing** to **high-throughput NGS** to **long-read real-time sequencing**, which is also called first-, second-, and third-generation sequencing.

2
ScRNA-Seq allows for the analysis of gene expression **at the individual cell level**, uncovering cellular heterogeneity and rare cell types that are often masked in bulk RNA-Seq.

In scRNA-Seq, transcript quantification converts the raw data into a table of estimated transcript counts per cell.
**Full-length** protocols capture entire transcripts.
**Tag-based** protocols sequence either the transcripts’ 3’ or 5’ ends.

4
ScRNA-Seq protocols vary in their approach to cell isolation and transcript recovery.
**Droplet-based** methods encapsulate cells into hydrogel droplets.
**Plate-based** physically separated cells into wells.
**Fluidigm C1** loads and separates cells into small reaction chambers.
