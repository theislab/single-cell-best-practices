Sequencing evolved from **Sanger sequencing** to **high-throughput NGS** to **long-read real-time sequencing**, which is also called first-, second-, and third-generation sequencing.

2
ScRNA-Seq allows for the analysis of gene expression **at the individual cell level**, uncovering cellular heterogeneity and rare cell types that are often masked in bulk RNA-Seq.

3
In scRNA-Seq, transcript quantification converts the raw data into a table of estimated transcript counts per cell.
**Full-length** protocols capture entire transcripts.
**Tag-based** protocols sequence either the transcripts’ 3’ or 5’ ends.

4
Transcription takes place in stochastic bursts and leads to a total of 100,000 to 1,000,000 mRNA molecules in a typical mammalian cell.

5
We categorize scRNA-seq techniques into two broad classes based on cell isolation into **droplets** (aqueous bubbles) or **physical compartments** (e.g. wells).
