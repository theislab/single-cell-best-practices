    "As we have discussed in the {ref}`analysis frameworks and tools chapter <introduction:analysis-frameworks>`, there are three main ecosystems for single-cell analysis: the [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/) and [Seurat](https://satijalab.org/seurat/index.html) ecosystems in R and the Python-based [scverse](https://scverse.org/) ecosystem.\n",
    "A common question from new analysts is which ecosystem they should focus on learning and using.\n",
    "While it makes sense to focus on one to start with, and a successful standard analysis can be performed in any ecosystem, we promote the idea that competent analysts should be familiar with all three ecosystems and comfortable moving between them.\n",
    "This approach allows analysts to use the best-performing tools and methods regardless of their implementation.\n",
    "When analysts are not comfortable moving between ecosystems, they often tend to use packages that are easy to access, even when they have been shown to have shortcomings compared to packages in another ecosystem.\n",
    "The ability of analysts to move between ecosystems allows developers to take advantage of the different strengths of programming languages.\n",
    "For example, R has strong built-in support for complex statistical modeling, while most deep-learning libraries focus on Python.\n",
    "By supporting common on-disk data formats and in-memory data structures, developers can be confident that analysts can access their packages and use the platform most appropriate for their method.\n",
    "Another motivation for being comfortable with multiple ecosystems is the accessibility and availability of data, results, and documentation.\n",
    "Data or results are often only made available in one format, and analysts will need to be familiar with that format to access it.\n",
    "A basic understanding of other ecosystems is also necessary to understand package documentation and tutorials when deciding which methods to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we encourage analysts to be comfortable with all the major ecosystems, moving between them is only possible when they are interoperable.\n",
    "Thankfully, much work has been done in this area, and using standard packages is now relatively simple in most cases.\n",
    "In this chapter, we discuss the various ways data can be moved between ecosystems via disk or memory, their differences, and their advantages.\n",
    "We focus on single-modality data and moving between R and Python, as these are the most common cases, but we also touch on multimodal data and other languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first import all required Python packages before going through the chapter."

    "The first approach to moving between languages is via disk-based interoperability.\n",

    "In many cases, this approach is simpler, more reliable and scalable than in-memory interoperability (which we discuss below).\n",
    "Still, it comes at the cost of greater storage requirements and reduced interactivity.\n",
    "Disk-based interoperability tends to work particularly well when there are established processes for each stage of analysis and you want to pass objects from one to the next (especially as part of a pipeline developed using a workflow manager such as [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/index.html) or [snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)).\n",
    "However, disk-based interoperability is less convenient for interactive steps such as data exploration or experimenting with methods, as you need to write a new file whenever you want to move between languages."

    "For example, you may want to transfer only the cell metadata but do not require the feature metadata, expression matrices etc.\n",
    "The advantage of using simple text formats is that they are well supported by almost any language and do not require single-cell specific packages.\n",
