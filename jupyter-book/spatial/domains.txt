Spatial domains are clusters that both reflecting similarity of spots or cells in terms of gene expression as well as spatial proximity.

2
Methods for identifying spatial domains can also incorporate the histological information available through spatial omics technologies.

We presented how to identify spatial domains in Squidpy by combining the nearest neighbor graph and the spatial proximity graph, as well as the usage of SpaGCN.
