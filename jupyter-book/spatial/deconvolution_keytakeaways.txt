1
Reference based deconvolution methods can be used for increasing the resolution of spot-based spatial transcriptomics data.

2
Cell2location outperformed other approaches for cell type deconvolution, but requires more computational resources.

3
Alternative models are SpatialDWLS and RCTD which perform best in terms of the overall accuracy score.
