    "# The Central Dogma of Molecular Biology\n",
    "\n",
    "The Central Dogma is a foundational concept in molecular biology that explains how genetic information flows within a cell. Proposed by Francis Crick in 1958, it outlines the sequential transfer of biological instructions from {term}`DNA` to {term}`RNA` to proteins, ensuring that genetic blueprints are accurately expressed to sustain life. This framework is essential for understanding gene expression, heredity, and the molecular mechanisms underlying cellular functions.\n",

    "```{admonition} Rosalind Franklin: The Unsung Hero of DNA's Discovery\n",
    ":class: dropdown\n",
    "Rosalind Franklin (1920–1958) was a brilliant chemist whose pioneering work in X-ray crystallography unlocked one of the greatest scientific discoveries of the 20th century—the structure of DNA. Her famous Photo 51, an X-ray diffraction image of DNA, provided the crucial evidence that revealed the molecule's double-helix structure. Though her data was shared without her full knowledge and later used by Watson and Crick to finalize their model, Franklin’s contributions were not properly acknowledged during her lifetime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond DNA, Franklin made groundbreaking advancements in virology, studying the structure of viruses like the tobacco mosaic virus, and even contributed to research on coal and graphite. Tragically, she passed away in 1958, just years before the Nobel Prize was awarded for the discovery of DNA’s structure—an honor she might have shared had she lived.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, Franklin is rightfully celebrated as a central figure in molecular biology, with numerous awards, institutions, and even a Mars rover named in her honor. Her legacy serves as both a scientific milestone and a reminder of the importance of recognizing all contributors to major discoveries.\n",

    "\n",
    "## The Three Major Processes of the Central Dogma\n",
    "\n",
    "The Central Dogma consists of three primary stages: replication, transcription, and translation.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Replication: DNA Copies Itself\n",
    "Replication is the process by which a cell duplicates its DNA before division, ensuring that each daughter cell receives an identical copy of the genetic material. This occurs during the S phase of the cell cycle and involves enzymes like DNA polymerase, which synthesizes a new DNA strand complementary to the original template. The result is two identical DNA molecules, each consisting of one old and one new strand (semi-conservative replication). Errors in replication can lead to mutations, which may affect gene function.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Transcription: DNA to RNA\n",
    "Transcription is the synthesis of RNA from a DNA template. Unlike replication, which copies the entire genome, transcription selectively produces RNA molecules (such as messenger RNA, mRNA) from specific genes. This process occurs in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells and is carried out by the enzyme RNA polymerase, which binds to promoter regions on DNA and assembles a complementary RNA strand. The resulting mRNA carries the genetic code from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it directs protein synthesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Translation: RNA to Protein\n",
    "Translation is the final step, where the information in mRNA is decoded to build a protein. This occurs on ribosomes, which read the mRNA sequence in groups of three nucleotides called codons. Each codon corresponds to a specific amino acid, delivered by transfer RNA (tRNA). As ribosomes move along the mRNA, they link amino acids together in the correct order, forming a polypeptide chain. Once complete, the polypeptide folds into a functional protein, which performs critical roles in cell structure, signaling, and metabolism.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exceptions and Modifications to the Central Dogma\n",
    "\n",
    "While the Central Dogma describes the primary flow of genetic information, certain exceptions exist. Some viruses, such as retroviruses (e.g., HIV), use reverse transcriptase to convert their RNA genome into DNA, which then integrates into the host cell’s chromosomes—a process called reverse transcription. Additionally, not all RNA molecules are translated into proteins; some, like ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and microRNA (miRNA), have regulatory or structural roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Biological Significance\n",
    "\n",
    "The Central Dogma is crucial for understanding how genes control cellular activities and how mutations can lead to diseases like cancer or genetic disorders. It also underpins biotechnological applications, such as genetic engineering, CRISPR gene editing, and synthetic biology, where scientists manipulate DNA, RNA, or proteins to modify organisms or develop therapies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the Central Dogma describes the unidirectional flow of genetic information from DNA → RNA → Protein, with replication ensuring genetic continuity, transcription enabling gene expression, and translation producing functional proteins. While exceptions exist, this framework remains a cornerstone of molecular biology, providing insights into life’s fundamental processes.\n",
