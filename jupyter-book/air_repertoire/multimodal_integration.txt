For multimodal datasets of AIR and GEX, typically, one modality is used for grouping the cells to perform standard uni-modal analysis on the other modality (e.g. Sequence analysis on leiden clusters).

2
Cell functionality (determined by AIR) and cell state (observed via GEX) are interlinked.
It has been shown, that cells with alike AIR sequences can share similar phenotypes.

Due to the inherent structural difference between count matrices (GEX) and amino acid sequences (IR), it is difficult to directly fuse both modalities.
Therefore, several methods were developed recently, to utilize paired GEX-AIR data for to derive clusters, or an embedding.
However, these approaches are still novel and not part of a standard analysis pipeline.
