Clonal Expansion: Specific lymphocytes proliferate in response to immune stimuli, reducing clonal diversity but increasing the abundance of expanded clones.
This process is critical for understanding immune responses, as it reflects the transition from naive to effector and memory cells.

Gene Segment Usage & Spectratype: The rearrangement of V(D)J gene segments shows preferential usage, and spectratype analysis measures CDR3 length diversity.
Together, they help identify immunodominant clonotypes and characterize immune repertoire patterns.
