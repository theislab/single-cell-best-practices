1
The AIR sequence determines the epitope-specificity of the cell.
Cells with similar AIR sequence, bind to the same antigen.

2
Specificity can be inferred via Database queries, AIR comparison, or prediction.

3
Most approaches are not independently benchmarked and should be used with some caution and additional validation.
