abstract = {Droplet-based microfluidic devices have become widely used to perform single-cell {term}`RNA` sequencing (scRNA-seq). However, ambient {term}`RNA` present in the cell suspension can be aberrantly counted along with a cell’s native mRNA and result in cross-contamination of transcripts between different cell populations. DecontX is a novel Bayesian method to estimate and remove contamination in individual cells. DecontX accurately predicts contamination levels in a mouse-human mixture dataset and removes aberrant expression of marker genes in PBMC datasets. We also compare the contamination levels between four different scRNA-seq protocols. Overall, DecontX can be incorporated into scRNA-seq workflows to improve downstream analyses.},

abstract = {Summary In single-cell {term}`RNA` sequencing (scRNA-seq), doublets form when two cells are encapsulated into one reaction volume. The existence of doublets, which appear to be—but are not—real cells, is a key confounder in scRNA-seq data analysis. Computational methods have been developed to detect doublets in scRNA-seq data; however, the scRNA-seq field lacks a comprehensive benchmarking of these methods, making it difficult for researchers to choose an appropriate method for specific analyses. We conducted a systematic benchmark study of nine cutting-edge computational doublet-detection methods. Our study included 16 real datasets, which contained experimentally annotated doublets, and 112 realistic synthetic datasets. We compared doublet-detection methods regarding detection accuracy under various experimental settings, impacts on downstream analyses, and computational efficiencies. Our results show that existing methods exhibited diverse performance and distinct advantages in different aspects. Overall, the DoubletFinder method has the best detection accuracy, and the cxds method has the highest computational efficiency. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the Supplemental Information.},

abstract = {Summary Single-cell {term}`RNA` sequencing (scRNA-seq) data are commonly affected by technical artifacts known as “doublets,” which limit cell throughput and lead to spurious biological conclusions. Here, we present a computational doublet detection tool—DoubletFinder—that identifies doublets using only gene expression data. DoubletFinder predicts doublets according to each real cell’s proximity in gene expression space to artificial doublets created by averaging the transcriptional profile of randomly chosen cell pairs. We first use scRNA-seq datasets where the identity of doublets is known to show that DoubletFinder identifies doublets formed from transcriptionally distinct cells. When these doublets are removed, the identification of differentially expressed genes is enhanced. Second, we provide a method for estimating DoubletFinder input parameters, allowing its application across scRNA-seq datasets with diverse distributions of cell types. Lastly, we present “best practices” for DoubletFinder applications and illustrate that DoubletFinder is insensitive to an experimentally validated kidney cell type with “hybrid” expression features.},

TITLE={A Comparison for Dimensionality Reduction Methods of Single-Cell {term}`RNA`-seq Data},

ABSTRACT={Single-cell {term}`RNA` sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a high-throughput sequencing technology performed at the level of an individual cell, which can have a potential to understand cellular heterogeneity. However, scRNA-seq data are high-dimensional, noisy, and sparse data. Dimension reduction is an important step in downstream analysis of scRNA-seq. Therefore, several dimension reduction methods have been developed. We developed a strategy to evaluate the stability, accuracy, and computing cost of 10 dimensionality reduction methods using 30 simulation datasets and five real datasets. Additionally, we investigated the sensitivity of all the methods to hyperparameter tuning and gave users appropriate suggestions. We found that t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) yielded the best overall performance with the highest accuracy and computing cost. Meanwhile, uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) exhibited the highest stability, as well as moderate accuracy and the second highest computing cost. UMAP well preserves the original cohesion and separation of cell populations. In addition, it is worth noting that users need to set the hyperparameters according to the specific situation before using the dimensionality reduction methods based on non-linear model and neural network.}
