ABSTRACT={Single-cell {term}`RNA` sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a high-throughput sequencing technology performed at the level of an individual cell, which can have a potential to understand cellular heterogeneity. However, scRNA-seq data are high-dimensional, noisy, and sparse data. Dimension reduction is an important step in downstream analysis of scRNA-seq. Therefore, several dimension reduction methods have been developed. We developed a strategy to evaluate the stability, accuracy, and computing cost of 10 dimensionality reduction methods using 30 simulation datasets and five real datasets. Additionally, we investigated the sensitivity of all the methods to hyperparameter tuning and gave users appropriate suggestions. We found that t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) yielded the best overall performance with the highest accuracy and computing cost. Meanwhile, uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) exhibited the highest stability, as well as moderate accuracy and the second highest computing cost. UMAP well preserves the original cohesion and separation of cell populations. In addition, it is worth noting that users need to set the hyperparameters according to the specific situation before using the dimensionality reduction methods based on non-linear model and neural network.}
