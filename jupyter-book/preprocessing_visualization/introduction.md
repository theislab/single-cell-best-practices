# Preprocessing & visualization introduction

This chapter will guide you through the steps of data preprocessing and visualization. Pre-processing aims to address the following analysis steps: quality control, normalization, feature selection, and dimensionality reduction. 

This chapter will additionally introduce the advanced topics of ambient RNA, single nuclei and interactive visualization. 

The starting point of this notebook are raw sequencing data generated by sequencing machines which are processed and aligned to obtain matrices of molecular counts, so called count matrices, or read counts (read matrices). The difference between cound and read matrices depends on whether unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) were included in the single-cell library construction protocol. 

Read and count matrices have the dimension number of barcodes x number of transcripts. It is important to note that the term "barcode" is used here instead of "cell" as a barcode might wrongly have tagged multiple cells (doublet) or might have not tagged any cell (empty droplet/well). We will elaborate more on this in the next section "Doublet detection & quality control".
