PCA is a linear dimensionality reduction technique that creates uncorrelated principal components ranked by variance, making it interpretable and efficient but less suitable for visualizing highly non-linear scRNA-seq data.

UMAP is a non-linear method that constructs and optimizes graph representations to preserve both local and global data structures, making it highly effective for visualization and clustering of single-cell data.
