1
Filtering of poor-quality cells should be based on median absolute deviations with lenient cutoffs to avoid bias against smaller subpopulations.

2
Feature-based filtering does not show benefits for downstream tasks. 

3
Doublets can be efficiently detected with tools like scDblFinder. 

4
Doublet detection methods should not be run on aggregated scRNA-seq data representing multiple batches.
