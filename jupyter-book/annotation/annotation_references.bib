abstract={Mapping the spatial distribution and molecular identity of constituent cells is essential for understanding tissue dynamics in health and disease. We lack a comprehensive map of human distal airways, including the terminal and respiratory bronchioles (TRBs), which are implicated in respiratory diseases1--4. Here, using spatial transcriptomics and single-cell profiling of microdissected distal airways, we identify molecularly distinct TRB cell types that have not---to our knowledge---been previously characterized. These include airway-associated LGR5+ fibroblasts and TRB-specific alveolar type-0 (AT0) cells and TRB secretory cells (TRB-SCs). Connectome maps and organoid-based co-cultures reveal that LGR5+ fibroblasts form a signalling hub in the airway niche. AT0 cells and TRB-SCs are conserved in primates and emerge dynamically during human lung development. Using a non-human primate model of lung injury, together with human organoids and tissue specimens, we show that alveolar type-2 cells in regenerating lungs transiently acquire an AT0 state from which they can differentiate into either alveolar type-1 cells or TRB-SCs. This differentiation programme is distinct from that identified in the mouse lung5--7. Our study also reveals mechanisms that drive the differentiation of the bipotent AT0 cell state into normal or pathological states. In sum, our findings revise human lung cell maps and lineage trajectories, and implicate an epithelial transitional state in primate lung regeneration and disease.},

A common step in the analysis of scRNA-seq data is the selection of so-called marker genes, most commonly to enable the annotation of the biological cell types present in the sample. In this paper we benchmarked and scrutinised 41 computational methods for selecting marker genes in scRNA-seq data. The performance of the methods was compared using 10 real scRNA-seq datasets and over 170 additional simulated datasets. The methods were compared based on their ability to recover simulated and expert-annotated marker genes, the predictive performance of the gene sets they select, their memory usage and speed, the quality of their implementations, and the characteristics of the marker genes they select. In addition, various case studies were used to highlight issues and inconsistencies in the most commonly used methods. Overall, we present a comprehensive evaluation of methods for selecting marker genes in scRNA-seq data. Our results highlight the efficacy of simple methods, especially the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Student{\textquoteright}s t-test and logistic regression.

Single-cell computational pipelines involve two critical steps: organizing cells (clustering) and identifying the markers driving this organization (differential expression analysis). State-of-the-art pipelines perform differential analysis after clustering on the same dataset. We observe that because clustering “forces” separation, reusing the same dataset generates artificially low p values and hence false discoveries. We introduce a valid post-clustering differential analysis framework, which corrects for this problem. We provide software at https://github.com/jessemzhang/tn_test.}

	abstract = {Organ- and body-scale cell atlases have the potential to transform our understanding of human biology. To capture the variability present in the population, these atlases must include diverse demographics such as age and ethnicity from both healthy and diseased individuals. The growth in both size and number of single-cell datasets, combined with recent advances in computational techniques, for the first time makes it possible to generate such comprehensive large-scale atlases through integration of multiple datasets. Here, we present the integrated Human Lung Cell Atlas (HLCA) combining 46 datasets of the human respiratory system into a single atlas spanning over 2.2 million cells from 444 individuals across health and disease. The HLCA contains a consensus re-annotation of published and newly generated datasets, resolving under- or misannotation of 59\% of cells in the original datasets. The HLCA enables recovery of rare cell types, provides consensus marker genes for each cell type, and uncovers gene modules associated with demographic covariates and anatomical location within the respiratory system. To facilitate the use of the HLCA as a reference for single-cell lung research and allow rapid analysis of new data, we provide an interactive web portal to project datasets onto the HLCA. Finally, we demonstrate the value of the HLCA reference for interpreting disease-associated changes. Thus, the HLCA outlines a roadmap for the development and use of organ-scale cell atlases within the Human Cell Atlas.Competing Interest StatementPRT serves as a consultant for Surrozen Inc., Cellarity Inc., and Celldom Inc. and currently acting CEO of Iolux Inc.

Cell types are the basic functional units of an organism. Cell types exhibit diverse phenotypic properties at multiple levels, making them challenging to define, categorize, and understand. This review provides an overview of the basic principles of cell types rooted in evolution and development and discusses approaches to characterize and classify cell types and investigate how they contribute to the organism’s function, using the mammalian brain as a primary example.

abstract={Community detection is often used to understand the structure of large and complex networks. One of the most popular algorithms for uncovering community structure is the so-called Louvain algorithm. We show that this algorithm has a major defect that largely went unnoticed until now: the Louvain algorithm may yield arbitrarily badly connected communities. In the worst case, communities may even be disconnected, especially when running the algorithm iteratively. In our experimental analysis, we observe that up to 25{\%} of the communities are badly connected and up to 16{\%} are disconnected. To address this problem, we introduce the Leiden algorithm. We prove that the Leiden algorithm yields communities that are guaranteed to be connected. In addition, we prove that, when the Leiden algorithm is applied iteratively, it converges to a partition in which all subsets of all communities are locally optimally assigned. Furthermore, by relying on a fast local move approach, the Leiden algorithm runs faster than the Louvain algorithm. We demonstrate the performance of the Leiden algorithm for several benchmark and real-world networks. We find that the Leiden algorithm is faster than the Louvain algorithm and uncovers better partitions, in addition to providing explicit guarantees.},

abstract = {Summary
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a T cell-mediated autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS). Bone marrow hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) rapidly sense immune activation, yet their potential interplay with autoreactive T cells in MS is unknown. Here, we report that bone marrow HSPCs are skewed toward myeloid lineage concomitant with the clonal expansion of T cells in MS patients. Lineage tracing in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a mouse model of MS, reveals remarkable bone marrow myelopoiesis with an augmented output of neutrophils and Ly6Chigh monocytes that invade the CNS. We found that myelin-reactive T cells preferentially migrate into the bone marrow compartment in a CXCR4-dependent manner. This aberrant bone marrow myelopoiesis involves the CCL5-CCR5 axis and augments CNS inflammation and demyelination. Our study suggests that targeting the bone marrow niche presents an avenue to treat MS and other autoimmune disorders.}

               gene targeting in mice, we previously showed that TEL-/- mice
               are embryonic lethal because of a yolk sac angiogenic defect.
               TEL also appears essential for the survival of selected neural
               and mesenchymal populations within the embryo proper. Here, we
               have generated mouse chimeras with TEL-/- ES cells to examine a
               possible requirement in adult hematopoiesis. Although not
               required for the intrinsic proliferation and/or differentiation
               of adult-type hematopoietic lineages in the yolk sac and fetal
               liver, TEL function is essential for the establishment of
               hematopoiesis of all lineages in the bone marrow. This defect is
               manifest within the first week of postnatal life. Our data

               hematopoietic activity from fetal liver to bone marrow. This
               might reflect an inability of TEL-/- hematopoietic stem cells or

Here we introduce a deep learning strategy for mapping query datasets on top of a reference called single-cell architectural surgery (scArches). scArches uses transfer learning and parameter optimization to enable efficient, decentralized, iterative reference building and contextualization of new datasets with existing references without sharing raw data. Using examples from mouse brain, pancreas, immune and whole-organism atlases, we show that scArches preserves biological state information while removing batch effects, despite using four orders of magnitude fewer parameters than de novo integration. scArches generalizes to multimodal reference mapping, allowing imputation of missing modalities. Finally, scArches retains coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease variation when mapping to a healthy reference, enabling the discovery of disease-specific cell states. scArches will facilitate collaborative projects by enabling iterative construction, updating, sharing and efficient use of reference atlases.},

abstract={Recent advances in single-cell technologies and integration algorithms make it possible to construct comprehensive reference atlases encompassing many donors, studies, disease states, and sequencing platforms. Much like mapping sequencing reads to a reference genome, it is essential to be able to map query cells onto complex, multimillion-cell reference atlases to rapidly identify relevant cell states and phenotypes. We present Symphony (https://github.com/immunogenomics/symphony), an algorithm for building large-scale, integrated reference atlases in a convenient, portable format that enables efficient query mapping within seconds. Symphony localizes query cells within a stable low-dimensional reference embedding, facilitating reproducible downstream transfer of reference-defined annotations to the query. We demonstrate the power of Symphony in multiple real-world datasets, including (1) mapping a multi-donor, multi-species query to predict pancreatic cell types, (2) localizing query cells along a developmental trajectory of fetal liver hematopoiesis, and (3) inferring surface protein expression with a multimodal CITE-seq atlas of memory T cells.},

abstract = {Summary
The simultaneous measurement of multiple modalities represents an exciting frontier for single-cell genomics and necessitates computational methods that can define cellular states based on multimodal data. Here, we introduce “weighted-nearest neighbor” analysis, an unsupervised framework to learn the relative utility of each data type in each cell, enabling an integrative analysis of multiple modalities. We apply our procedure to a CITE-seq dataset of 211,000 human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with panels extending to 228 antibodies to construct a multimodal reference atlas of the circulating immune system. Multimodal analysis substantially improves our ability to resolve cell states, allowing us to identify and validate previously unreported lymphoid subpopulations. Moreover, we demonstrate how to leverage this reference to rapidly map new datasets and to interpret immune responses to vaccination and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Our approach represents a broadly applicable strategy to analyze single-cell multimodal datasets and to look beyond the transcriptome toward a unified and multimodal definition of cellular identity.}
