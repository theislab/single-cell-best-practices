abstract={Mapping the spatial distribution and molecular identity of constituent cells is essential for understanding tissue dynamics in health and disease. We lack a comprehensive map of human distal airways, including the terminal and respiratory bronchioles (TRBs), which are implicated in respiratory diseases1--4. Here, using spatial transcriptomics and single-cell profiling of microdissected distal airways, we identify molecularly distinct TRB cell types that have not---to our knowledge---been previously characterized. These include airway-associated LGR5+ fibroblasts and TRB-specific alveolar type-0 (AT0) cells and TRB secretory cells (TRB-SCs). Connectome maps and organoid-based co-cultures reveal that LGR5+ fibroblasts form a signalling hub in the airway niche. AT0 cells and TRB-SCs are conserved in primates and emerge dynamically during human lung development. Using a non-human primate model of lung injury, together with human organoids and tissue specimens, we show that alveolar type-2 cells in regenerating lungs transiently acquire an AT0 state from which they can differentiate into either alveolar type-1 cells or TRB-SCs. This differentiation programme is distinct from that identified in the mouse lung5--7. Our study also reveals mechanisms that drive the differentiation of the bipotent AT0 cell state into normal or pathological states. In sum, our findings revise human lung cell maps and lineage trajectories, and implicate an epithelial transitional state in primate lung regeneration and disease.},

abstract = {Despite their crucial role in health and disease, our knowledge of immune cells within human tissues remains limited. We surveyed the immune compartment of 16 tissues from 12 adult donors by single-cell RNA sequencing and VDJ sequencing generating a dataset of ~360,000 cells. To systematically resolve immune cell heterogeneity across tissues, we developed CellTypist, a machine learning tool for rapid and precise cell type annotation. Using this approach, combined with detailed curation, we determined the tissue distribution of finely phenotyped immune cell types, revealing hitherto unappreciated tissue-specific features and clonal architecture of T and B cells. Our multitissue approach lays the foundation for identifying highly resolved immune cell types by leveraging a common reference dataset, tissue-integrated expression analysis, and antigen receptor sequencing. The human immune system is composed of many different cell types spread across the entire body, but little is currently known about the fine-grained variations in these cell types across organs. Using single-cell genomics, Domínguez Conde et al. examined the gene expression profile of more than 300,000 individual immune cells extracted from 16 different tissues in 12 deceased adult organ donors (see the Perspective by Liu and Zhang). Cell identity was assigned using CellTypist, an automated cell classification tool designed by the authors. In-depth data analysis revealed insights into how the immune system adapts to function effectively in different organ contexts. —LZ and DJ An immune cell atlas of human innate and adaptive immune cells across lymphoid, mucosal, and exocrine sites reveals tissue-specific compositions and features.}}

	abstract = {The development of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has enabled scientists to catalogue and probe the transcriptional heterogeneity of individual cells in unprecedented detail. A common step in the analysis of scRNA-seq data is the selection of so-called marker genes, most commonly to enable the annotation of the biological cell types present in the sample. In this paper we benchmarked and scrutinised 41 computational methods for selecting marker genes in scRNA-seq data. The performance of the methods was compared using 10 real scRNA-seq datasets and over 170 additional simulated datasets. The methods were compared based on their ability to recover simulated and expert-annotated marker genes, the predictive performance of the gene sets they select, their memory usage and speed, the quality of their implementations, and the characteristics of the marker genes they select. In addition, various case studies were used to highlight issues and inconsistencies in the most commonly used methods. Overall, we present a comprehensive evaluation of methods for selecting marker genes in scRNA-seq data. Our results highlight the efficacy of simple methods, especially the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Student{\textquoteright}s t-test and logistic regression.

Cell type annotation is a crucial step in analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing data, yet manual annotation is time-consuming and partially subjective. As an alternative, tools have been developed for automatic cell type identification. Different strategies have emerged to ultimately associate gene expression profiles of single cells with a cell type either by using curated marker gene databases, correlating reference expression data, or transferring labels by supervised classification. In this review, we present an overview of the available tools and the underlying approaches to perform automated cell type annotations on scRNA-seq data.}

abstract = {Summary
Single-cell computational pipelines involve two critical steps: organizing cells (clustering) and identifying the markers driving this organization (differential expression analysis). State-of-the-art pipelines perform differential analysis after clustering on the same dataset. We observe that because clustering “forces” separation, reusing the same dataset generates artificially low p values and hence false discoveries. We introduce a valid post-clustering differential analysis framework, which corrects for this problem. We provide software at https://github.com/jessemzhang/tn_test.}

	abstract = {Organ- and body-scale cell atlases have the potential to transform our understanding of human biology. To capture the variability present in the population, these atlases must include diverse demographics such as age and ethnicity from both healthy and diseased individuals. The growth in both size and number of single-cell datasets, combined with recent advances in computational techniques, for the first time makes it possible to generate such comprehensive large-scale atlases through integration of multiple datasets. Here, we present the integrated Human Lung Cell Atlas (HLCA) combining 46 datasets of the human respiratory system into a single atlas spanning over 2.2 million cells from 444 individuals across health and disease. The HLCA contains a consensus re-annotation of published and newly generated datasets, resolving under- or misannotation of 59\% of cells in the original datasets. The HLCA enables recovery of rare cell types, provides consensus marker genes for each cell type, and uncovers gene modules associated with demographic covariates and anatomical location within the respiratory system. To facilitate the use of the HLCA as a reference for single-cell lung research and allow rapid analysis of new data, we provide an interactive web portal to project datasets onto the HLCA. Finally, we demonstrate the value of the HLCA reference for interpreting disease-associated changes. Thus, the HLCA outlines a roadmap for the development and use of organ-scale cell atlases within the Human Cell Atlas.Competing Interest StatementPRT serves as a consultant for Surrozen Inc., Cellarity Inc., and Celldom Inc. and currently acting CEO of Iolux Inc.
