1
Use unbiased reference data with no missing cell type.

2
Normalize the reference data using library size normalization.

3
Feature selection prior deconvolution improves the accuracy of the results particularly for linear deconvolution methods. 

4
Deconvolution is a challenging task (see limitations and traps). Therefore, we recommend the users to try more than one deconvolution method and select one after assessing the results biologically.
