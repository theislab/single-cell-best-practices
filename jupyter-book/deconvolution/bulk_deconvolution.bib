abstract = {The quanta unit of the immune system is the cell, yet analyzed samples are often heterogeneous with respect to cell subsets which can mislead result interpretation. Experimentally, researchers face a difficult choice whether to profile heterogeneous samples with the ensuing confounding effects, or a priori focus on a few cell subsets of interest, potentially limiting new discoveries. An attractive alternative solution is to extract cell subset-specific information directly from heterogeneous samples via computational deconvolution techniques, thereby capturing both cell-centered and whole system level context. Such approaches are capable of unraveling novel biology, undetectable otherwise. Here we review the present state of available deconvolution techniques, their advantages and limitations, with a focus on blood expression data and immunological studies in general.}

abstract = {Scaden enables robust cell type deconvolution of complex samples across data types, using a deep learning–based model. We present Scaden, a deep neural network for cell deconvolution that uses gene expression information to infer the cellular composition of tissues. Scaden is trained on single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data to engineer discriminative features that confer robustness to bias and noise, making complex data preprocessing and feature selection unnecessary. We demonstrate that Scaden outperforms existing deconvolution algorithms in both precision and robustness. A single trained network reliably deconvolves bulk RNA-seq and microarray, human and mouse tissue expression data and leverages the combined information of multiple datasets. Because of this stability and flexibility, we surmise that deep learning will become an algorithmic mainstay for cell deconvolution of various data types. Scaden’s software package and web application are easy to use on new as well as diverse existing expression datasets available in public resources, deepening the molecular and cellular understanding of developmental and disease processes.}}

    abstract = "{Estimating cell type composition of blood and tissue samples is a biological challenge relevant in both laboratory studies and clinical care. In recent years, a number of computational tools have been developed to estimate cell type abundance using gene expression data. Although these tools use a variety of approaches, they all leverage expression profiles from purified cell types to evaluate the cell type composition within samples. In this study, we compare 12 cell type quantification tools and evaluate their performance while using each of 10 separate reference profiles. Specifically, we have run each tool on over 4000 samples with known cell type proportions, spanning both immune and stromal cell types. A total of 12 of these represent in vitro synthetic mixtures and 300 represent in silico synthetic mixtures prepared using single-cell data. A final 3728 clinical samples have been collected from the Framingham cohort, for which cell populations have been quantified using electrical impedance cell counting. When tools are applied to the Framingham dataset, the tool Estimating the Proportions of Immune and Cancer cells (EPIC) produces the highest correlation, whereas Gene Expression Deconvolution Interactive Tool (GEDIT) produces the lowest error. The best tool for other datasets is varied, but CIBERSORT and GEDIT most consistently produce accurate results. We find that optimal reference depends on the tool used, and report suggested references to be used with each tool. Most tools return results within minutes, but on large datasets runtimes for CIBERSORT can exceed hours or even days. We conclude that deconvolution methods are capable of returning high-quality results, but that proper reference selection is critical.}",

Here, we propose SCDC, a deconvolution method for bulk RNA-seq that leverages cell-type specific gene expression profiles from multiple scRNA-seq reference datasets. SCDC adopts an ENSEMBLE method to integrate deconvolution results from different scRNA-seq datasets that are produced in different laboratories and at different times, implicitly addressing the problem of batch-effect confounding. SCDC is benchmarked against existing methods using both in silico generated pseudo-bulk samples and experimentally mixed cell lines, whose known cell-type compositions serve as ground truths. We show that SCDC outperforms existing methods with improved accuracy of cell-type decomposition under both settings. To illustrate how the ENSEMBLE framework performs in complex tissues under different scenarios, we further apply our method to a human pancreatic islet dataset and a mouse mammary gland dataset. SCDC returns results that are more consistent with experimental designs and that reproduce more significant associations between cell-type proportions and measured phenotypes.}",
