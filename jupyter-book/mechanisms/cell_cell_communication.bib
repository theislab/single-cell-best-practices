abstract = {The use of single-cell transcriptomics has become a major approach to delineate cell subpopulations and the transitions between them. While various computational tools using different mathematical methods have been developed to infer clusters, marker genes, and cell lineage, none yet integrate these within a mathematical framework to perform multiple tasks coherently. Such coherence is critical for the inference of cell-cell communication, a major remaining challenge. Here, we present similarity matrix-based optimization for single-cell data analysis ({SoptSC}), in which unsupervised clustering, pseudotemporal ordering, lineage inference, and marker gene identification are inferred via a structured cell-to-cell similarity matrix. {SoptSC} then predicts cell-cell communication networks, enabling reconstruction of complex cell lineages that include feedback or feedforward interactions. Application of {SoptSC} to early embryonic development, epidermal regeneration, and hematopoiesis demonstrates robust identification of subpopulations, lineage relationships, and pseudotime, and prediction of pathway-specific cell communication patterns regulating processes of development and differentiation. \copyright The Author(s) 2019.

In contrast to other repositories, our database takes into account the subunit architecture of both ligands and receptors, representing heteromeric complexes accurately. We integrated our resource with a statistical framework that predicts enriched cellular interactions between two cell types from single-cell transcriptomics data.

abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Ligand-receptor (L-R) interactions mediate cell adhesion, recognition and communication and play essential roles in physiological and pathological signaling. With the rapid development of single-cell {RNA} sequencing ({scRNA}-seq) technologies, systematically decoding the intercellular communication network involving L-R interactions has become a focus of research. Therefore, construction of a comprehensive, high-confidence and well-organized resource to retrieve L-R interactions in order to study the functional effects of cell-cell communications would be of great value. {RESULTS}: In this study, we developed Cellinker, a manually curated resource of literature-supported L-R interactions that play roles in cell-cell communication. We aimed to provide a useful platform for studies on cell-cell communication mediated by L-R interactions. The current version of Cellinker documents over 3,700 human and 3,200 mouse L-R protein-protein interactions ({PPIs}) and embeds a practical and convenient webserver with which researchers can decode intercellular communications based on {scRNA}-seq data. And over 400 endogenous small molecule ({sMOL}) related L-R interactions were collected as well. Moreover, to help with research on coronavirus ({CoV}) infection, Cellinker collects information on 16 L-R {PPIs} involved in {CoV}-human interactions (including 12 L-R {PPIs} involved in {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection). In summary, Cellinker provides a user-friendly interface for querying, browsing and visualizing L-R interactions as well as a practical and convenient web tool for inferring intercellular communications based on {scRNA}-seq data. We believe this platform could promote intercellular communication research and accelerate the development of related algorithms for {scRNA}-seq studies. {AVAILABILITY}: Cellinker is available at http://www.rna-society.org/cellinker/. {SUPPLEMENTARY} {INFORMATION}: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online. \copyright The Author(s) (2021).

Using high-throughput spatial transcriptomic data and single-cell {RNA} sequencing data with receptor gene perturbation, we demonstrate that {CytoTalk} has substantial improvement over existing algorithms. To better understand plasticity of signaling networks across tissues and developmental stages, we perform a comparative analysis of signaling networks between macrophages and endothelial cells across human adult and fetal tissues. Our analysis reveals an overall increased plasticity of signaling networks across adult tissues and specific network nodes that contribute to increased plasticity. {CytoTalk} enables de novo construction of signal transduction pathways and facilitates comparative analysis of these pathways across tissues and conditions.

Here, we developed {CellCall}, a toolkit to infer inter- and intracellular communication pathways by integrating paired ligand-receptor and transcription factor ({TF}) activity. Moreover, {CellCall} uses an embedded pathway activity analysis method to identify the significantly activated pathways involved in intercellular crosstalk between certain cell types.

Comparative analysis of {CellCall} and other tools indicated that {CellCall} was more accurate and offered more functions. In summary, {CellCall} provides a sophisticated and practical tool allowing researchers to decipher intercellular communication and related internal regulatory signals based on {scRNA}-seq data. {CellCall} is freely available at https://github.com/{ShellyCoder}/cellcall. \copyright The Author(s) 2021.

We then apply Scriabin to uncover co-expressed programs of {CCC} from atlas-scale datasets, validating known communication pathways required for maintaining the intestinal stem cell niche and revealing species-specific communication pathways. Finally, we utilize single-cell communication networks calculated using Scriabin to follow communication pathways that operate between timepoints in longitudinal datasets, highlighting bystander cells as important initiators of inflammatory reactions in acute {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection.

Applying {MEBOCOST} on brown adipose tissue ({BAT}) showed the robustness of predicting known and novel metabolite-based autocrine and paracrine communications. Additionally, {MEBOCOST} identified a set of intercellular metabolite-sensor communications that was regulated by cold exposure in {BAT}. Those predicted communicating metabolites and sensors may play important roles in thermogenesis regulation.

Many computational tools were developed for this purpose. Each of them consists of a resource of intercellular interactions prior knowledge and a method to predict potential cell-cell communication events. Yet the impact of the choice of resource and method on the resulting predictions is largely unknown. To shed light on this, we systematically compare 16 cell-cell communication inference resources and 7 methods, plus the consensus between the methods' predictions. Among the resources, we find few unique interactions, a varying degree of overlap, and an uneven coverage of specific pathways and tissue-enriched proteins. We then examine all possible combinations of methods and resources and show that both strongly influence the predicted intercellular interactions. Finally, we assess the agreement of cell-cell communication methods with spatial colocalisation, cytokine activities, and receptor protein abundance and find that predictions are generally coherent with those data modalities. To facilitate the use of the methods and resources described in this work, we provide {LIANA}, a {LIgand}-receptor {ANalysis} {frAmework} as an open-source interface to all the resources and methods. \copyright 2022.

Historically, limited tissue accessibility, a lack of reliable in vitro models and critical differences between humans and mice have hampered our knowledge of human gonadogenesis, despite its importance in gonadal conditions and infertility. Here, we generated a comprehensive map of first- and second-trimester human gonads using a combination of single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, chromatin accessibility assays and fluorescent microscopy. We extracted human-specific regulatory programmes that control the development of germline and somatic cell lineages by profiling equivalent developmental stages in mice. In both species, we define the somatic cell states present at the time of sex specification, including the bipotent early supporting population that, in males, upregulates the testis-determining factor {SRY} and {sPAX8s}, a gonadal lineage located at the gonadal-mesonephric interface. In females, we resolve the cellular and molecular events that give rise to the first and second waves of granulosa cells that compartmentalize the developing ovary to modulate germ cell differentiation. In males, we identify human {SIGLEC15}+ and {TREM2}+ fetal testicular macrophages, which signal to somatic cells outside and inside the developing testis cords, respectively. This study provides a comprehensive spatiotemporal map of human and mouse gonadal differentiation, which can guide in vitro gonadogenesis. \copyright 2022. The Author(s).}

abstract = {Cell interactions determine phenotypes, and intercellular communication is shaped by cellular contexts such as disease state, organismal life stage, and tissue microenvironment. Single-cell technologies measure the molecules mediating cell-cell communication, and emerging computational tools can exploit these data to decipher intercellular communication. However, current methods either disregard cellular context or rely on simple pairwise comparisons between samples, thus limiting the ability to decipher complex cell-cell communication across multiple time points, levels of disease severity, or spatial contexts. Here we present Tensor-cell2cell, an unsupervised method using tensor decomposition, which deciphers context-driven intercellular communication by simultaneously accounting for multiple stages, states, or locations of the cells. To do so, Tensor-cell2cell uncovers context-driven patterns of communication associated with different phenotypic states and determined by unique combinations of cell types and ligand-receptor pairs. As such, Tensor-cell2cell robustly improves upon and extends the analytical capabilities of existing tools. We show Tensor-cell2cell can identify multiple modules associated with distinct communication processes (e.g., participating cell-cell and ligand-receptor pairs) linked to severities of Coronavirus Disease 2019 and to Autism Spectrum Disorder. Thus, we introduce an effective and easy-to-use strategy for understanding complex communication patterns across diverse conditions. \copyright 2022. The Author(s).}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Cell-cell interactions are important for information exchange between different cells, which are the fundamental basis of many biological processes. Recent advances in single-cell {RNA} sequencing ({scRNA}-seq) enable the characterization of cell-cell interactions using computational methods. However, it is hard to evaluate these methods since no ground truth is provided. Spatial transcriptomics ({ST}) data profiles the relative position of different cells. We propose that the spatial distance suggests the interaction tendency of different cell types, thus could be used for evaluating cell-cell interaction tools. {RESULTS}: We benchmark 16 cell-cell interaction methods by integrating {scRNA}-seq with {ST} data. We characterize cell-cell interactions into short-range and long-range interactions using spatial distance distributions between ligands and receptors. Based on this classification, we define the distance enrichment score and apply an evaluation workflow to 16 cell-cell interaction tools using 15 simulated and 5 real {scRNA}-seq and {ST} datasets. We also compare the consistency of the results from single tools with the commonly identified interactions. Our results suggest that the interactions predicted by different tools are highly dynamic, and the statistical-based methods show overall better performance than network-based methods and {ST}-based methods. {CONCLUSIONS}: Our study presents a comprehensive evaluation of cell-cell interaction tools for {scRNA}-seq. {CellChat}, {CellPhoneDB}, {NicheNet}, and {ICELLNET} show overall better performance than other tools in terms of consistency with spatial tendency and software scalability. We recommend using results from at least two methods to ensure the accuracy of identified interactions. We have packaged the benchmark workflow with detailed documentation at {GitHub} ( https://github.com/wanglabtongji/{CCI} ). \copyright 2022. The Author(s).}

abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Recent years have seen the release of several toolsets that reveal cell-cell interactions from single-cell data. However, all existing approaches leverage mean celltype gene expression values, and do not preserve the single-cell fidelity of the original data. Here, we present {NICHES} (Niche Interactions and Communication Heterogeneity in Extracellular Signaling), a tool to explore extracellular signaling at the truly single-cell level. {RESULTS}: {NICHES} allows embedding of ligand-receptor signal proxies to visualize heterogeneous signaling archetypes within cell clusters, between cell clusters and across experimental conditions. When applied to spatial transcriptomic data, {NICHES} can be used to reflect local cellular microenvironment. {NICHES} can operate with any list of ligand-receptor signaling mechanisms, is compatible with existing single-cell packages, and allows rapid, flexible analysis of cell-cell signaling at single-cell resolution. {AVAILABILITY} {AND} {IMPLEMENTATION}: {NICHES} is an open-source software implemented in R under academic free license v3.0 and it is available at http://github.com/msraredon/{NICHES}. Use-case vignettes are available at https://msraredon.github.io/{NICHES}/. {SUPPLEMENTARY} {INFORMATION}: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online. \copyright The Author(s) 2022.

abstract = {Cell-cell interactions ({CCIs}) are essential for multicellular organisms to coordinate biological processes and functions. One classical type of {CCI} interaction is between secreted ligands and cell surface receptors, i.e. ligand-receptor ({LR}) interactions. With the recent development of single-cell technologies, a large amount of single-cell ribonucleic acid ({RNA}) sequencing ({scRNA}-Seq) data has become widely available. This data availability motivated the single-cell-resolution study of {CCIs}, particularly {LR}-based {CCIs}. Dozens of computational methods and tools have been developed to predict {CCIs} by identifying {LR}-based {CCIs}. Many of these tools have been theoretically reviewed. However, there is little study on current {LR}-based {CCI} prediction tools regarding their performance and running results on public {scRNA}-Seq datasets. In this work, to fill this gap, we tested and compared nine of the most recent computational tools for {LR}-based {CCI} prediction. We used 15 well-studied {scRNA}-Seq samples that correspond to approximately {100K} single cells under different experimental conditions for testing and comparison. Besides briefing the methodology used in these nine tools, we summarized the similarities and differences of these tools in terms of both {LR} prediction and {CCI} inference between cell types. We provided insight into using these tools to make meaningful discoveries in understanding cell communications. \copyright The Author(s) 2022. Published by Oxford University Press.}
