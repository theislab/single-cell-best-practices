Ligand-receptor inference methods and intracellular signaling models (e.g., NicheNet) are complementary approaches for understanding CCC.

2
Cell-cell communication (CCC) inference from single-cell transcriptomics data relies on the assumption that gene expression is a proxy for protein abundance and intercellular interactions.
