1
When applying Augur ensure that the cell types can be confidently labeled.
Use differential abundance tests to find confounding effects and differential gene expression to find gene-level sources of perturbation effects.

2
Predicting perturbation responses with tools such as scGen works well for highly expressed genes, but is challenging for lowly expressed genes.

The linear discriminant analysis step of the Mixscape pipeline primarily aids with visualization.
Distances in UMAPs should be interpreted with caution and therefore similarities and differences between knockouts cannot always be inferred at a glance.
