If the primary interest lies in compositional changes among known cell-types or states, use scCODA or tascCODA to statistically evaluate changes in abundance.

KNN based methods like DA-Seq or MILO should be used if the data does not cluster distinctly, such as during developmental processes, if we are interested in differences in cell abundances that might appear in transitional states between cell types or in a specific subset of cells of a given cell type.
