Repeated measurements (cells) from the same experimental subject in scRNA-seq introduce correlations between measurements, which need to be adjusted by modeling the experimental units as Random Effect to mitigate the pseudoreplication issue.
Account for them through a sum or mean aggregation (pseudobulk methods - by fixed- or random effect terms) or by accounting for individual as a random effect (single-cell methods) to mitigate the pseudoreplication issue.

Statistical power is best increased with more samples in the experimental design.
