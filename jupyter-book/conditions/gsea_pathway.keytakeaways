1
Normalise your data using standard scRNA-seq normalisation methods and filter gene sets with low gene coverage in your data prior to pathway analysis.

2
Be aware of different types of gene set testing tests (i.e. competitive vs self-contained) and use one that suits your application.

2
Be aware of differences between gene set enrichment and gene set activity inference.
*GSEA* is the widely used gene set test in single-cell studies; Pagoda 2 is found to outperform other pathway activity scoring tools.
If your datasets has complex experimental design, consider pseudo-bulk analysis with gene set tests implemented in *limma*, as they are compatible with the linear model framework can additionally account for inter-gene correlations.
