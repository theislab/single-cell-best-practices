The integration of single-cell multi-modal data (e.g., gene expression and chromatin accessibility) is challenging due to differences in dimensionality and data distributions across modalities, but tools like MOFA+, WNN, totalVI, and multiVI aim to address these challenges.

Query-to-reference mapping allows for the integration of new data into a pre-existing reference framework, enabling tasks like cell type prediction and imputation of missing modalities (e.g., predicting protein abundance from RNA-seq data)
