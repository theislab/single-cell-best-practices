  abstract     = {Single-cell multimodal omics technologies provide a holistic approach to study cellular decision making. Yet, learning from multimodal data is complicated because of missing and incomplete reference samples, non-overlapping features and batch effects between datasets. To integrate and provide a unified view of multi-modal datasets, we propose Multigrate. Multigrate is a generative multi-view neural network to build multimodal reference atlases. In contrast to existing methods, Multigrate is not limited to specific paired assays, and it compares favorably to existing data-specific methods on both integration and imputation tasks. We further show that Multigrate equipped with transfer learning enables mapping a query multimodal dataset into an existing reference atlas.Competing Interest StatementFabian J.

  abstract = {Large single-cell atlases are now routinely generated to serve as references for analysis of smaller-scale studies. Yet learning from reference data is complicated by batch effects between datasets, limited availability of computational resources and sharing restrictions on raw data. Here we introduce a deep learning strategy for mapping query datasets on top of a reference called single-cell architectural surgery (scArches). scArches uses transfer learning and parameter optimization to enable efficient, decentralized, iterative reference building and contextualization of new datasets with existing references without sharing raw data. Using examples from mouse brain, pancreas, immune and whole-organism atlases, we show that scArches preserves biological state information while removing batch effects, despite using four orders of magnitude fewer parameters than de novo integration. scArches generalizes to multimodal reference mapping, allowing imputation of missing modalities. Finally, scArches retains coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease variation when mapping to a healthy reference, enabling the discovery of disease-specific cell states. scArches will facilitate collaborative projects by enabling iterative construction, updating, sharing and efficient use of reference atlases.},
