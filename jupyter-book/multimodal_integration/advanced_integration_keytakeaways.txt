Advanced multimodal integration techniques techniques are particularly useful when data from different modalities (e.g., RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and ADT) originate from separate experiments and are not jointly measured per cell.

Query-to-reference mapping allows for the integration of new data into a pre-existing reference framework, enabling tasks like cell type prediction and imputation of missing modalities (e.g., predicting protein abundance from RNA-seq data)
