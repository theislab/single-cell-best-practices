    "## The Three Major Processes of the Central Dogma\n",
    "\n",
    "The Central Dogma consists of three primary stages: replication, transcription, and translation.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Replication: DNA Copies Itself\n",
    "\n",
    "Replication is the process by which a cell duplicates its DNA before division, ensuring that each daughter cell receives an identical copy of the genetic material.\n",
    "This occurs during the S phase of the cell cycle and involves enzymes like DNA polymerase, which synthesizes a new DNA strand complementary to the original template.\n",
    "The result is two identical DNA molecules, each consisting of one old and one new strand (semi-conservative replication).\n",
    "Errors in replication can lead to mutations, which may affect gene function.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Transcription: DNA to RNA\n",
    "\n",
    "Transcription is the synthesis of RNA from a DNA template.\n",
    "Unlike replication, which copies the entire genome, transcription selectively produces RNA molecules (such as messenger RNA, mRNA) from specific genes.\n",
    "This process occurs in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells and is carried out by the enzyme RNA polymerase, which binds to promoter regions on DNA and assembles a complementary RNA strand.\n",
    "The resulting mRNA carries the genetic code from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it directs protein synthesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Translation: RNA to Protein\n",
    "\n",
    "Translation is the final step, where the information in mRNA is decoded to build a protein.\n",
    "This occurs on ribosomes, which read the mRNA sequence in groups of three nucleotides called codons.\n",
    "Each codon corresponds to a specific amino acid, delivered by transfer RNA (tRNA).\n",
    "As ribosomes move along the mRNA, they link amino acids together in the correct order, forming a polypeptide chain.\n",
    "Once complete, the polypeptide folds into a functional protein, which performs critical roles in cell structure, signaling, and metabolism.\n",
