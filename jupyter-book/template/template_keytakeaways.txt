The Central Dogma outlines the flow of genetic information from DNA to RNA to protein, consisting of three main processes: replication, transcription, and translation.

Exceptions exist, such as reverse transcription in retroviruses (e.g., HIV), where RNA is converted back into DNA, and non-coding RNAs (e.g., rRNA, miRNA) that perform regulatory or structural roles.

Understanding the Central Dogma is essential for studying genetic diseases, biotechnological applications (e.g., CRISPR), and the fundamental mechanisms of gene expression and heredity.
