    "Cellular lineages are ubiquitious in biology. Perhaps the most famous example is that of embyrogenesis: the process by which an organism like a human being is generated from from a single cell, the fertilized egg. During this process, subsequent cell divisions give rise to daughter cells and over time entire \"lineages\" that can take on specialized roles within the developing embryo. The amazing complexity of this process has captured the imagination of scientists for centuries, and over the past century and a half our understanding of this process has been bolstered by the development of high-throughput sequencing assays and new \"lineage tracing\" technologies for visualizing and characterizing this process {cite}`Woodworth2017`.\n",

    "\n",
    "The marriage of single-cell assays and lineage tracing approaches has yielded an exponential growth in the complexity of datasets, requiring the development of new computational methodology for their analysis. As such, there has been a strong need in developing new computational methodology for processing these datasets {cite}`DreamChallenge`. Sourcing heavily from population genetics literature, the past half decade has witnessed an exciting confluence of traditional concepts in evolutionary biology with cutting-edge genome engineering techniques.     \n",

    "## Lineage tracing technologies\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of lineage tracing techniques is to infer lineage, or ancestry relationships between observed cells. In this, there are two major variables to consider: scale and resolution. Classical approaches relied heavily on visual observation: for example, in the 1970s Sulston and colleagues derived the first developmental lineage of the nematode _C. elegans_ by meticulously watching cell divisions under a microscope {cite}`Sulston1973`. While playing an imperative role in the progression of the field, such approaches cannot scale to complex organisms with more stochastic developmental lineages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the past two decades, the development of revolutionary sequencing assays and microfluidic devices has contributed to the development of new and diverse lineage tracing methodology. To digest the plethora of techniques, it is helpful to classify approaches as \"_prospective_\" or \"_retrospective_\". Generally speaking, prospective lineage tracing approaches use a heritable marker to trace a clonal population (i.e., all the descendants of a single cell). On the other hand, retrospective lineage tracing approaches use variability amongst observed cells - such as naturally occuring genetic mutations - to infer a model of their lineage, or \"_phylogeny_\", summarizing the cell division history of a clonal population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several approaches have been developed for prospectively tracing a clonal population: for example, recombinases under a tissue-specific promoter can be used to activate fluorscent markers that act as heritable marks for a specific tissue lineage {cite}`brainbow`. Alternatively, lentiviral transduction can be used to integrate random DNA barcodes into cellular genomes to provide a heritable mark that can be used to deconvovle clonal identities with a sequencing readout. Though these approaches are highly scalable and often do not require heavy genome engineering, they can only report properties at the clonal-level such as clone size and composition.\n",
    "Retrospective lineage tracers overcome these limitations and provide an additional advantage over prospective tracers in that they can only report properties at the clonal-level such as clone size and composition, and are restricted to systems that are accessible to genome engineering. Traditionally, this has been done by leveraging natural genetic variation between cells to reconstruct a cell division history. While this approach is still widely and successfully used to study human tumors or tissue developmental histories, experimentalists have little or no control over how often or where mutations occur. In experimental models, there are opportunities to recapitulate the advantages of retrospective tracers while improving on the caveats by engineering evolvable lineage tracers. Such evolving tracers typically consist of engineering cells with a \"scratchpad\" (or, synonymously, \"target site\") that can acquire mutations. For example, a popular approach that this chapter focuses on uses Cas9 to introduce insertions and deletions (i.e., \"indels\") at the target site. In this way, cellular lineages acquire heritable mutations over time that can be subsequently read out with high-throughput sequencing platforms and used to infer phylogenies representing a model of the cell lineage.\n",
    "\n",
    "To note, both classes of lineage-tracing approaches can take advantage of adjacent advances in single-cell multiomic profiling. For example, investigators have routinely used single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) to read out simultaneously the functional state of single cells and their lineage relationships. This multimodal readout has created opportunity for new computational methodologies, which we detail below. \n",
    "\n",
    "As stated above, in this chapter we provide a detailed walkthrough on the analysis of data from evolving CRISPR/Cas9-based lineage tracers.\n",

    "## Overview of evolving lineage tracing data analysis pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "Before delving into the analysis of our example dataset, we will provide an overview of the computational pipeline for the analysis of data generated by evolving tracers. In general, with these systems, analysis will begin with raw sequencing data of an _amplicon_ library of target sites (often derived from a conventional scRNA-seq platform like 10X Chromium). Depending on the technology at hand, each sequenced amplicon will be between 150-300bp long; in the case of CRISPR/Cas9-based evolving tracers, each read will contain one more Cas9 cut sites. Within the preprocessing of this data, anlaysts are tasked with aligning the reads to a reference sequence and identifying any mutations (e.g., indels). \n",
    "\n",
    "While the preprocessing of these datasets is a critical step, in the interest of space, we focus on analysis pipelines  that receive preprocessed sequencing data as input and refer the reader to an external preprocessing tutorial which can be found here: https://cassiopeia-lineage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/preprocess.html.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In most analysis frameworks, the preprocessing of the raw sequencing reads produces a data structure called the **character matrix** (denoted by $\\chi$) that summarizes the observed mutations in each cell across the target sites. In this data structure, each row is a cell (or \"sample\"), each column is a target site (or \"character\"), and the (row, column) values are categorical variables representing the identity of the indel observed in that cell at that particular cut site (or \"character-state\"). Depending on the technology at hand, these character matrices can report on anywhere between 100 and 10,000 samples across up to 100 characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, this data structure abstracts away the technicalities of the evolving lineage tracing assay and opens up the opportunity to computationally infer a **phylogenetic tree** ($\\mathcal{T}$) over the cells. Specifically, the goal is to learn a hierarchical tree structure over each of the cells in $\\chi$ (our character matrix). In this tree, each node represents a sample and each edge represents a lineage relationship. Importantly, we often have only observed the _leaves_ (denoted by $\\mathcal{L}$) of the tree and we refer to any of the unobserved set of internal nodes as _ancestral_ nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many algorithmic choices for inferring the phylogenetic tree ($\\mathcal{T}$) from the character matrix $\\chi$, which can be generally broken up into \"character-based\" and \"distance-based\" approaches:\n",
    "- Character-based: perform a combinatorial search through all possible tree topologies while seeking to optimize a function over the characters (e.g., the likelihood of the evolutionary history given the mutations observed in the characters). \n",
    "- distance-based (e.g Neighbor-Joining): use a notion of cell-cell distances (denoted by $\\delta$) to infer a phylogenetic tree and typically run in polynomial time. While distance-based approaches can perform much faster, they require one to iteratively find the best cell-cell dissimilarity function which can be equally time consuming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following phylogenetic tree reconstruction, there are several options for downstream analysis. For example, one can learn about the rates of cell state changes across the developmental history or the relative propensities of cells to divide in a population. Below, we will demonstrate via code examples across two major case studies how these different components fit together to gain fundamental insights into the dynamic processes underlying cellular lineages.\n",
