abstract = {The last decade has witnessed a technological arms race to encode the molecular states of cells into DNA libraries, turning DNA sequencers into scalable single-cell microscopes. Single-cell measurement of chromatin accessibility (DNA), gene expression (RNA), and proteins has revealed rich cellular diversity across tissues, organisms, and disease states. However, single-cell data poses a unique set of challenges. A dataset may comprise millions of cells with tens of thousands of sparse features. Identifying biologically relevant signals from the background sources of technical noise requires innovation in predictive and representational learning. Furthermore, unlike in machine vision or natural language processing, biological ground truth is limited. Here we leverage recent advances in multi-modal single-cell technologies which, by simultaneously measuring two layers of cellular processing in each cell, provide ground truth analogous to language translation. We define three key tasks to predict one modality from another and learn integrated representations of cellular state. We also generate a novel dataset of the human bone marrow specifically designed for benchmarking studies. The dataset and tasks are accessible through an open-source framework that facilitates centralized evaluation of community-submitted methods.},

   abstract = {The development of single-cell multimodal assays provides a powerful tool for investigating multiple dimensions of cellular heterogeneity, enabling new insights into development, tissue homeostasis and disease. A key challenge in the analysis of single-cell multimodal data is to devise appropriate strategies for tying together data across different modalities. The term ‘data integration’ has been used to describe this task, encompassing a broad collection of approaches ranging from batch correction of individual omics datasets to association of chromatin accessibility and genetic variation with transcription. Although existing integration strategies exploit similar mathematical ideas, they typically have distinct goals and rely on different principles and assumptions. Consequently, new definitions and concepts are needed to contextualize existing methods and to enable development of new methods. As the number of single-cell experiments with multiple data modalities increases, Argelaguet and colleagues review the concepts and challenges of data integration.},

   abstract = {Single-cell atlases often include samples that span locations, laboratories and conditions, leading to complex, nested batch effects in data. Thus, joint analysis of atlas datasets requires reliable data integration. To guide integration method choice, we benchmarked 68 method and preprocessing combinations on 85 batches of gene expression, chromatin accessibility and simulation data from 23 publications, altogether representing >1.2 million cells distributed in 13 atlas-level integration tasks. We evaluated methods according to scalability, usability and their ability to remove batch effects while retaining biological variation using 14 evaluation metrics. We show that highly variable gene selection improves the performance of data integration methods, whereas scaling pushes methods to prioritize batch removal over conservation of biological variation. Overall, scANVI, Scanorama, scVI and scGen perform well, particularly on complex integration tasks, while single-cell ATAC-sequencing integration performance is strongly affected by choice of feature space. Our freely available Python module and benchmarking pipeline can identify optimal data integration methods for new data, benchmark new methods and improve method development. This benchmarking study compares 16 methods for integrating complex single-cell RNA and ATAC datasets and provides a guide to method choice.},

We assessed the cell-type-specific expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and CTSL across 107 single-cell RNA-sequencing studies from different tissues. ACE2, TMPRSS2 and CTSL are coexpressed in specific subsets of respiratory epithelial cells in the nasal passages, airways and alveoli, and in cells from other organs associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission or pathology. We performed a meta-analysis of 31 lung single-cell RNA-sequencing studies with 1,320,896 cells from 377 nasal, airway and lung parenchyma samples from 228 individuals. This revealed cell-type-specific associations of age, sex and smoking with expression levels of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and CTSL. Expression of entry factors increased with age and in males, including in airway secretory cells and alveolar type 2 cells. Expression programs shared by ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + cells in nasal, lung and gut tissues included genes that may mediate viral entry, key immune functions and epithelial-macrophage cross-talk, such as genes involved in the interleukin-6, interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor and complement pathways. Cell-type-specific expression patterns may contribute to the pathogenesis of COVID-19, and our work highlights putative molecular pathways for therapeutic intervention.},

   abstract = {Organ- and body-scale cell atlases have the potential to transform our understanding of human biology. To capture the variability present in the population, these atlases must include diverse demographics such as age and ethnicity from both healthy and diseased individuals. The growth in both size and number of single-cell datasets, combined with recent advances in computational techniques, for the first time makes it possible to generate such comprehensive large-scale atlases through integration of multiple datasets. Here, we present the integrated Human Lung Cell Atlas (HLCA) combining 46 datasets of the human respiratory system into a single atlas spanning over 2.2 million cells from 444 individuals across health and disease. The HLCA contains a consensus re-annotation of published and newly generated datasets, resolving under- or misannotation of 59\% of cells in the original datasets. The HLCA enables recovery of rare cell types, provides consensus marker genes for each cell type, and uncovers gene modules associated with demographic covariates and anatomical location within the respiratory system. To facilitate the use of the HLCA as a reference for single-cell lung research and allow rapid analysis of new data, we provide an interactive web portal to project datasets onto the HLCA. Finally, we demonstrate the value of the HLCA reference for interpreting disease-associated changes. Thus, the HLCA outlines a roadmap for the development and use of organ-scale cell atlases within the Human Cell Atlas.},

Even for scRNA-seq data this method is still the highest performing batch correction method (cf. buettner et al., BioarXiv, 2017).<br/><br/>COMBAT removes batch effects by including them as covariates in a linear model (both additive and multiplicative factors). These covariates are fit from the data using an Empirical Bayes estimate to deal with small sample sizes and possible gene outliers. This is done by assuming that the batch covariates were drawn from a Gaussian (additive) or Inverse Gamma (multiplicative) distribution. The hyperparameters of these distributions are again fit from the data.<br/><br/>The paper shows that this method produces robust, reliable batch correction, which outperforms other more complex methods especially for low sample sizes.<br/><br/>The method includes a design matrix in which covariates can be included that model the experimental design.},

   abstract = {Single-cell RNA-seq has enabled gene expression to be studied at an unprecedented resolution. The promise of this technology is attracting a growing user base for single-cell analysis methods. As more analysis tools are becoming available, it is becoming increasingly difficult to navigate this landscape and produce an up-to-date workflow to analyse one’s data. Here, we detail the steps of a typical single-cell RNA-seq analysis, including pre-processing (quality control, normalization, data correction, feature selection, and dimensionality reduction) and cell- and gene-level downstream analysis. We formulate current best-practice recommendations for these steps based on independent comparison studies. We have integrated these best-practice recommendations into a workflow, which we apply to a public dataset to further illustrate how these steps work in practice. Our documented case study can be found at https://www.github.com/theislab/single-cell-tutorial. This review will serve as a workflow tutorial for new entrants into the field, and help established users update their analysis pipelines.},

@article{Buttner2019,
   abstract = {Single-cell transcriptomics is a versatile tool for exploring heterogeneous cell populations, but as with all genomics experiments, batch effects can hamper data integration and interpretation. The success of batch-effect correction is often evaluated by visual inspection of low-dimensional embeddings, which are inherently imprecise. Here we present a user-friendly, robust and sensitive k-nearest-neighbor batch-effect test (kBET; https://github.com/theislab/kBET) for quantification of batch effects. We used kBET to assess commonly used batch-regression and normalization approaches, and to quantify the extent to which they remove batch effects while preserving biological variability. We also demonstrate the application of kBET to data from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors to distinguish cell-type-specific inter-individual variability from changes in relative proportions of cell populations. This has important implications for future data-integration efforts, central to projects such as the Human Cell Atlas.},

It was shown that COMBAT outperforms the others in all test setups (finding the correct highly variable genes, or mixing replicate batches). Normalization methods such as log(counts +1) or log(CPM+1) work best with COMBAT.<br/><br/>Finally it was also shown that data sets from different studies can even be combined when COMBAT is used.},

   abstract = {As the cost of single-cell RNA-seq experiments has decreased, an increasing number of datasets are now available. Combining newly generated and publicly accessible datasets is challenging due to non-biological signals, commonly known as batch effects. Although there are several computational methods available that can remove batch effects, evaluating which method performs best is not straightforward. Here, we present BatchBench (https://github.com/cellgeni/batchbench), a modular and flexible pipeline for comparing batch correction methods for single-cell RNA-seq data. We apply BatchBench to eight methods, highlighting their methodological differences and assess their performance and computational requirements through a compendium of well-studied datasets. This systematic comparison guides users in the choice of batch correction tool, and the pipeline makes it easy to evaluate other datasets.},

@article{Swamy2021,
   abstract = {Background: The development of highly scalable single-cell transcriptome technology has resulted in the creation of thousands of datasets, >30 in the retina alone. Analyzing the transcriptomes between different projects is highly desirable because this would allow for better assessment of which biological effects are consistent across independent studies. However it is difficult to compare and contrast data across different projects because there are substantial batch effects from computational processing, single-cell technology utilized, and the natural biological variation. While many single-cell transcriptome-specific batch correction methods purport to remove the technical noise, it is difficult to ascertain which method functions best. Results: We developed a lightweight R package (scPOP, single-cell Pick Optimal Parameters) that brings in batch integration methods and uses a simple heuristic to balance batch merging and cell type/cluster purity. We use this package along with a Snakefile-based workflow system to demonstrate how to optimally merge 766,615 cells from 33 retina datsets and 3 species to create a massive ocular single-cell transcriptome meta-atlas. Conclusions: This provides a model for how to efficiently create meta-atlases for tissues and cells of interest.},
