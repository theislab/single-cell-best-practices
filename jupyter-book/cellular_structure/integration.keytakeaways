Visualize your data before attempting to correct for batch effects to assess the extent of the issue.
Batch effect correction is not always required and it might mask the biological variation of interest.

2
If cell labels are available and biological variation is the most important, the usage of methods that can use these labels (such as scANVI) is advised.

Consider running several integration methods on your dataset and evaluating them with the **scIB** metrics to use the integration that is most robust for your use case.
